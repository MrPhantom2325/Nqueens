# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Abstract

The N-Queens problem is a classic computational puzzle that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This project presents a modern web-based implementation of the N-Queens problem solver using Next.js, TypeScript, and interactive visualization components. The solution demonstrates various algorithmic approaches including backtracking and provides an intuitive user interface for visualizing the problem-solving process.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About the Domain

The N-Queens problem is a generalization of the classic 8-Queens puzzle, first proposed by chess player Max Bezzel in 1848. The problem asks: "How can N queens be placed on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other?" This constraint means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The problem belongs to the class of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and serves as an excellent example for demonstrating:

- Backtracking algorithms
- Recursive problem-solving techniques
- Combinatorial optimization
- Algorithm visualization


### 1.3 Scope and Objectives

**Scope:**

- Implement a web-based N-Queens solver for board sizes from 4×4 to 12×12
- Provide interactive visualization of the solving process
- Support multiple solving algorithms
- Offer step-by-step solution playback
- Responsive design for various devices


**Objectives:**

- Create an educational tool for understanding backtracking algorithms
- Demonstrate modern web development practices using Next.js and TypeScript
- Provide an intuitive user interface for problem interaction
- Implement efficient algorithms with performance optimization
- Enable users to visualize and understand the problem-solving process
